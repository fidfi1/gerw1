# The App Academy Culture Curriculum

At App Academy we feel that many folks involved with the tech industry are under-informed about Diversity and Inclusion(D&I) issues that affect its population every day. Our hope is that by providing resources about these issues and raising awareness, we can foster a healthier community and prepare you future developers to improve and contribute to this industry.

We have curated a collection of different articles and resources that all aim to increase our community's cultural literacy and foster an inclusive environment. They are grouped into rotating categories, and are optional materials/learnings.

### Goals:

+ Inform students about important socio-cultural issues related to the tech industry
+ Paint a picture of the factual social state of the tech industry today and bring light to issues in tech that are talked about at large
+ Allow students to better understand the tangible social impacts of their work in the tech industry and familiarize them with big-picture discussions surrounding their work
+ Provide resources for those who want to be supportive allies but don't know how or where to start when trying to inform themselves
+ Make learning about social issues feel engaging and relevant
