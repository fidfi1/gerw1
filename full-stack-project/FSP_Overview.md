# Full Stack Project

The Full Stack Project is the final project in the App Academy Full Stack Developer Curriculum. Here you will take the skills and knowledge that you have gained throughout the course and use it to make your first Full Stack Application. You will use Ruby on Rails in conjunction with React and Redux to make a single page application clone of an existing website. This module has resources to help you on your way to building this application over the next two weeks. This is the time for you to revisit readings, videos, and other documentation from previous weeks as well as searching things up on your own just as you will in your careers. Make the most of your independence as you problem solve and manage your schedules to complete your project in time. This will be the centerpiece of your future portfolios and your efforts and diligence here will show in the functionality and appearance of your final product. 

There will not be any more Flex Time at the end of the day, and there will be no more pairing for the rest of the course. You will however, have periodic check-ins with your Full Stack Project Advisor. Keep them in the loop as you work through your project and complete MVP's(Minimum Viable Product). Start with User Authentication and then come up with a plan with your Project Advisor from there. Your PA is your best resource if you get stuck or have specific questions about your project.

Good Luck Programmers!
