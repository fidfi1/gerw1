an app to build. You will start by submitting a list of three possible
apps you would be interested in creating. This is your _tentative
proposal_. You will be assigned one of them. Important deadline for the tentative
proposal:


  * **W7D2**: Submit your tentative proposal by 9am
    * [Tentative proposal guidelines][tentative-proposal]
    * [List of approved apps][good-projects]

long to learn as normal CSS.
