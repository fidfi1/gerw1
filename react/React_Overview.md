## Notes

React is the last instructional module in the App Academy Full Stack Developer Curriculum. Our React module will have the last assessment on W8D2, where you will be able to track our progress and understanding of the material as you learn it.

As with all future modules, any "Bonus" projects are to be completed after the standard projects for each day are completed. Sometimes that could mean going back to previous day's "Bonus" projects if you otherwise finish early. Additional Resources are readings, videos, or articles that are not required, but will serve to deepen your understanding of a topic. They will be denoted with a specific icon in your task menu.
